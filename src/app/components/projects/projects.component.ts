Users can be created, fetched, updated, and deleted from the MongoDB database, showcasing CRUD operations. With pagination implemented on the server-side, the app allows smooth navigation of large datasets. It uses EJS for templating, jQuery for AJAX interactions, and Node.js with Express for backend functionality.",

  "projectName": "Real-Time Ride Booking and Driver Management System",
  "description": "This project is a real-time ride-booking and driver management application built using the MERN stack with a focus on real-time updates, payment handling, and distributed system management. The system allows users (drivers and customers) to book rides, handle driver assignments, and track the status of their rides in real-time. It leverages multiple advanced technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and reliability.\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. **Real-time Communication**: The app uses Socket.io to establish real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients. As a result, booking updates, driver assignments, and other important status changes are reflected instantly across all users.\n\n2. **Distributed System with Clustering**: Node.js Clustering ensures that the app can handle heavy traffic by forking multiple worker processes based on the number of CPU cores, improving the appâ€™s ability to scale and manage multiple simultaneous requests.\n\n3. **Session Management with Redis**: The app uses Redis for session management and caching. Redis is leveraged to store user session data, manage active sessions, and automatically clean up expired sessions, ensuring better performance and quick access to frequently used data.\n\n4. **Booking and Ride Management**: MongoDB stores all booking and ride-related information. The system allows users to book rides, assign drivers, and track the status of their rides. Each booking's state (such as Pending, Accepted, or Rejected) is updated in real time based on driver responses.\n\n5. **Payment Integration**: Stripe handles payments for ride bookings, ensuring secure and reliable transactions within the app. This integration makes it possible to charge users and process payments in a seamless manner.\n\n6. **Scheduled Jobs for Driver Reassignments**: The app includes a scheduling system for automatic driver reassignments. If a driver rejects a ride or becomes unavailable, the system automatically schedules the next available driver to take over the ride.\n\n7. **Advanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures that any failures in booking, payment, or driver assignment are gracefully handled and reported back to the users.",
